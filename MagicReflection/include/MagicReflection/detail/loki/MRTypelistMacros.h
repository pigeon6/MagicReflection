     macros MR_TL_1, MR_TL_2, ... MR_TL_50
     Each takes a number of arguments equal to its numeric suffix
     The arguments are type names. MR_TL_NN generates a typelist containing 
         all types passed as arguments, in that order.
     Example: MR_TL_2(char, int) generates a type containing char and int.
